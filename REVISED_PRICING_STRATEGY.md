## 💬 FAQ UPDATES

**Q: Why is your basic report cheaper than facilities?**

A: We use the exact same medically-approved algorithms testing facilities use to calculate VO2 max, RMR, training zones, and all metabolic metrics.

The difference? We don't have the overhead of physical facilities, equipment maintenance, or staff. We're a software platform that analyzes test results you already have.

Testing facilities need to charge $175-250 to cover their operating costs. We can offer the same analysis for $69 because our costs are minimal.

**Q: Is the $69 basic report as good as what facilities provide?**

A: Yes. We use industry-standard, peer-reviewed algorithms - the same ones facilities use. Your VO2 max calculation, RMR analysis, and training zones are identical to what you'd get from a $175-250 facility report.

The only difference is presentation and delivery speed. We deliver instantly vs 1-2 weeks.

**Q: What's the difference between Basic and AI-Enhanced?**

A: **Basic Report ($69):**
Core metabolic analysis using proven algorithms. Everything facilities charge $175-250 for. No AI involved - just medical-grade calculations you can trust.

**AI-Enhanced ($99):**
Everything in Basic Report PLUS AI-generated supplement suggestions, peptide protocols, training recommendations, and nutrition strategies. The AI suggestions should be verified with healthcare professionals.

**Q: Can I just buy the basic report without AI?**

A: Absolutely! Many users just want the core metabolic analysis (VO2 max, RMR, zones, charts) without AI recommendations. That's $69 and includes everything facilities charge $175-250 for.

You can always add AI recommendations later for $30.
