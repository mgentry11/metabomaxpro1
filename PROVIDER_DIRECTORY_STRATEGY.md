## 🤝 PARTNERSHIP LEVERAGE

### Using Referral Data

**After 10 referrals to a facility:**

```
Email to facility owner:

"Hi [Facility Owner],

I'm reaching out from MetaboMaxPro. Over the past month,
we've referred 10+ clients to your facility for metabolic testing.

Our platform helps people understand their VO2 max test results
and turn them into actionable training, nutrition, and supplement protocols.

Many of our users are asking where to get tested, and we've been
recommending your facility based on your equipment and expertise.

I'd love to discuss a formal partnership where we can:
1. Continue sending you qualified leads for testing
2. Provide your clients with comprehensive AI-powered reports
3. Increase your client retention with quarterly retesting

## 🎯 PARTNERSHIP PITCH USING REFERRALS

**After 25+ referrals:**

```
Subject: MetaboMaxPro has sent you 25+ clients - let's partner

Hi [Facility Owner],

I wanted to reach out personally. Over the past 3 months, we've referred
25+ potential clients to your facility for metabolic testing.

Here's what we've been doing:
- Users discover MetaboMaxPro for report analysis
- They ask "where can I get tested?"
- We recommend your facility (among others in [City])
- They book with you ($350 per test = $8,750 in potential revenue)

We've essentially been a free lead generation source for you.

Now, I'd like to discuss a formal partnership where we can:

1. INCREASE YOUR REVENUE
   - Continue sending qualified leads
   - Add $200 MetaboMaxPro report to each test
   - Your new package: $350 test + $200 report = $550
   - Your cut: Keep $420 (we get $130)
   - Net increase: $70 MORE per client

2. IMPROVE CLIENT RETENTION
   - Clients with MetaboMaxPro reports retest quarterly (not annually)
   - Lifetime value: $1,600+ instead of $350
   - We handle all report generation (zero work for you)

3. DIFFERENTIATE FROM COMPETITORS
   - "AI-powered analysis included with every test"
   - White-label option available (your branding)
   - Clients get actionable protocols, not just PDFs

We've proven we can send you business. Now let's make it official
and BOTH make more money.
