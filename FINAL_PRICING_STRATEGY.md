## 💬 UPDATED FAQ

**Q: Why do you offer 2 free reports?**

A: We want you to experience the full value of professional metabolic analysis without any risk. Two free reports lets you:
1. Try your initial test
2. Retest later to track progress

After that, you can upgrade to unlimited basic reports for $69 (less than facilities charge for ONE report) or add AI recommendations for $99.

**Q: What happens after my 2 free reports?**

A: After your 2 free basic reports, you have options:
- **$69 one-time:** Unlimited basic reports forever
- **$99 one-time:** Unlimited basic + 10 AI enhancements
- **$39/month:** Everything unlimited (best value for monthly testing)

You keep access to all your previous reports forever, regardless of which plan you choose.

**Q: How does this compare to testing facilities?**

A: Testing facilities charge $175-250 PER REPORT for the same basic metabolic analysis we provide. We give you 2 FREE to start, then:
- Unlimited basic reports: $69 (vs $175-250 each at facilities)
- With AI recommendations: $99 (facilities don't even offer AI analysis)

**Q: Can I upgrade later?**

A: Absolutely! Start with 2 free reports. If you love them, upgrade anytime:
- Need more basic reports? → $69 for unlimited
- Want AI recommendations? → $99 for unlimited basic + 10 AI credits

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Database Changes Needed:

**Existing `subscriptions` table has:**
- `reports_generated` (int) ✅
- `reports_limit` (int) ✅

**Set limits:**
```python
# Free tier
reports_limit = 2  # Only 2 free basic reports

# $69 unlimited basic
reports_limit = 9999  # Effectively unlimited

# $99 AI package
reports_limit = 9999  # Unlimited basic
ai_credits = 10  # Track AI usage separately

# $39/month subscription
reports_limit = 9999  # Unlimited
ai_credits = 9999  # Unlimited AI
```

### New Field Needed:
```sql
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN ai_credits INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

### Report Generation Logic:

```python
def can_generate_basic_report(user_id):
    subscription = get_subscription(user_id)

    if subscription.reports_generated < subscription.reports_limit:
        return True

    return False

def can_generate_ai_recommendations(user_id):
    subscription = get_subscription(user_id)

    # Subscribers get unlimited
    if subscription.tier == 'subscription':
        return True

    # AI package has credits
    if subscription.ai_credits > 0:
        return True

    return False
```
