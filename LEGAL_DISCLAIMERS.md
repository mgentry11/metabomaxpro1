### FAQ Section - Add These

**Q: Is this medical advice?**
```
A: No. MetaboMaxPro is a data analysis tool that provides educational information
based on your metabolic test results. All reports should be shared with and
discussed with qualified healthcare providers before implementation. We strongly
recommend working with a doctor, registered dietitian, certified trainer, or
other licensed professionals who can provide personalized medical guidance.
```

**Q: Can I use this instead of seeing a doctor?**
```
A: Absolutely not. MetaboMaxPro is designed to ENHANCE your work with healthcare
professionals, not replace them. Think of it as homework you bring to your doctor
to have more informed conversations. Never start new protocols without medical
supervision.
```

**Q: Who should review my reports?**
```
A: We recommend sharing your MetaboMaxPro reports with:
- Your primary care physician
- Endocrinologist or hormone specialist (for peptide info)
- Registered dietitian (for nutrition recommendations)
- Certified personal trainer or exercise physiologist (for training zones)
- Any specialist relevant to your health goals

These professionals can provide personalized medical advice based on your complete
health history, current conditions, and medications.
```

**Q: Are peptide recommendations safe to follow?**
```
A: Peptide information in our reports is educational only. Peptides are powerful
compounds that require medical supervision. Work ONLY with a licensed healthcare
provider who can legally prescribe peptides, order necessary bloodwork, monitor
for side effects, and adjust protocols based on your response. Never self-prescribe
or purchase peptides without medical oversight.
