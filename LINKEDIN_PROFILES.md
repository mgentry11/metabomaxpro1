**Turn Your VO2 Max Test Into An Action Plan**

Most people spend $200-400 on metabolic testing, get a bunch of numbers they don't understand, and have no idea what to do next. MetaboMaxPro solves this.

**The Problem We Solve:**
Metabolic testing is incredibly valuable - it gives you the most accurate data about YOUR body's performance. That $300-400 investment is worth every penny.

But here's the gap: You get amazing data... then what? Understanding what it means and how to act on it often requires another $200-500 investment.

**Our Solution:**
We believe the insights shouldn't cost as much as the test itself. Upload your metabolic test PDF (PNOE, Korr, COSMED, or any system) and get a comprehensive AI-powered report in 60 seconds that includes:

✅ Personalized peptide protocols based on your metabolic data
✅ Supplement stacks optimized for your RMR and substrate utilization
✅ Precise heart rate training zones for maximum efficiency
✅ Nutrition timing and macros calculated from your fat/carb oxidation rates
✅ 12-week progressive training plans

## 👤 FOUNDER/CEO PERSONAL PROFILE

### Name
Mark Gentry *(adjust if this isn't you)*

### Headline (max 220 characters)
Founder & CEO at MetaboMaxPro | Turning Metabolic Test Results Into Actionable Protocols | AI + Health Optimization | Helping 1000+ Athletes & Biohackers Unlock Their Data

### About Section (max 2,600 characters)

**I spent $400 on a VO2 max test and left with a number I didn't understand.**

That was 2 years ago. I got my results, saw "38.2 ml/kg/min" and the technician said "pretty average for your age." That was it. No action plan. No next steps.

When I asked how to improve it, they offered a $500 consultation package.

Look, I get it - larger companies have overhead, staff to pay, operating costs. They need to charge professional rates. That's just business.

But here's what struck me: After already spending $400 on the test itself, having to pay another $500 just to understand what to DO with the results felt like a barrier that shouldn't exist.

So I started digging. I analyzed 1,000+ metabolic test reports. I interviewed exercise physiologists, longevity doctors, and peptide experts. I learned what the numbers ACTUALLY mean and more importantly—what to DO about them.

**Then I built MetaboMaxPro.**

My mission: Make actionable metabolic insights accessible to everyone who invests in testing - without requiring another $500 paywall.

**What We Do:**
We turn your metabolic test results (VO2 max, RMR, substrate utilization) into personalized action plans in 60 seconds using AI.

Upload your PNOE, Korr, COSMED—any metabolic test PDF—and get:
✅ Peptide protocols optimized for YOUR metabolism
✅ Supplement stacks based on your oxidation rates
✅ Training zones calculated from your actual lactate threshold
✅ Nutrition timing aligned with your fat/carb burn ratios
✅ 12-week improvement plans with quarterly testing checkpoints

**Who This Helps:**

🏃‍♂️ Athletes who want to train smarter, not just harder
🧬 Biohackers optimizing peptides, NAD, and longevity protocols
🏥 Testing facilities looking to add $120-150/test in revenue
💪 Coaches who want data-driven client programming

**My Background:**
- 15 years in health tech and AI development
- Analyzed 1,000+ metabolic profiles to build our algorithms
- Recovered from metabolic dysfunction using the exact protocols we now automate
- Former "average" VO2 max of 38 → now 52+ using targeted interventions

**Why I'm Obsessed With This:**
Metabolic testing is one of the BEST investments you can make in your health. Getting accurate data about YOUR body's performance is invaluable.

But there's a gap: After spending $300-400 on this amazing test, you often need to spend another $200-500 just to understand what to do with the results.

I respect that professional consultations have value and that larger firms have costs to cover. But as a lean startup, I can deliver the same personalized protocols through AI at a fraction of the cost.

The result? Everyone who invests in testing can afford the insights - not just those who can pay for premium consultations.

**Plus:** With subscriptions, you can retest quarterly and focus on different health areas each time - peptides one quarter, training optimization the next, supplement protocols after that. Your data, infinite possibilities.

**What I'm Building:**
A world where every $300 metabolic test comes with a $3,000-quality action plan. Where you don't need a PhD to understand what your RMR means. Where peptide protocols are personalized, not copy-pasted from Reddit.

**Current Focus:**
- Scaling MetaboMaxPro to 10,000 users in 2025
- Partnering with 100+ testing facilities for white-label integration
- Building the world's largest database of metabolic optimization outcomes

**Let's Connect If You:**
- Run a testing facility (PNOE, Korr, etc.) and want to discuss partnerships
- Are a coach/trainer looking to add metabolic analysis to your services
- Want to collaborate on metabolic research or content
- Just love talking about VO2 max, peptides, and optimization

## 🚀 FIRST 5 POSTS TO MAKE

### Post 1 - Launch Announcement (Personal + Company)
```
I just launched MetaboMaxPro 🚀

Here's why:

I spent $400 on a VO2 max test - BEST decision ever. Having accurate data about my body's performance was incredible.

Then I asked: "What should I do to improve this?"

The answer: Another $500 for a consultation.

I get it - bigger firms have staff, overhead, operating costs to cover. But as someone who just invested $400 in testing, that second paywall felt like a barrier.

So I built an alternative.

MetaboMaxPro uses AI to turn your test results into actionable protocols in 60 seconds:

✅ Personalized peptide protocols
✅ Supplement stacks for YOUR metabolism
✅ Training zones from YOUR data
✅ Nutrition timing strategies
✅ 12-week improvement plans

One-time: $49-99
Subscription: Unlimited re-analysis focusing on different health areas (peptides → training → supplements)

Not to compete with professional consultations.

To make insights accessible to everyone who invests in the testing they need.

Your metabolic data is too valuable to sit unused.

### Post 2 - Educational Value (3 days later)
```
Most people train in the wrong heart rate zones 😬

Here's why:

Your "Zone 2" is NOT 60-70% of max heart rate.

It's the zone where your body burns fat most efficiently—and that's unique to YOUR metabolism.

Example from a recent MetaboMaxPro report:
- 35-year-old male
- Max HR: 185 bpm
- Generic Zone 2: 111-129 bpm ❌
- ACTUAL Zone 2 (from metabolic test): 125-142 bpm ✅

He was training 14 bpm too low for 6 months. No wonder his VO2 max wasn't improving.

Got a metabolic test? Upload it to metabomaxpro.com and see your REAL zones.

### Post 3 - Problem/Solution Story (1 week later)
```
Metabolic testing is one of the BEST investments you can make 💪

Getting accurate VO2 max, RMR, and substrate utilization data about YOUR body? Worth every penny of that $300-400.

But here's what happens next:

You get this incredible data... and then you need to spend ANOTHER $200-500 just to understand what to do with it.

I get it - big firms have overhead, staff, insurance. They need to charge those rates.

But here's my question:

Should understanding your own health data cost as much as (or more than) the test itself?

That's the gap MetaboMaxPro fills.

Upload your test → Get personalized protocols in 60 seconds:
✅ Peptide recommendations based on YOUR metabolism
✅ Training zones from YOUR lactate threshold
✅ Supplement stacks for YOUR oxidation rates
✅ Nutrition timing strategies
✅ 12-week improvement plans

One-time: $49-99
Subscription: Re-upload quarterly, focus on different areas each time (peptides → training → supplements → nutrition)

Not competing with consultations.

### Post 5 - User Results/Testimonial (3 weeks in)
```
"VO2 max went from 41 to 48 in 12 weeks using the MetaboMaxPro protocol" 💪

Here's what Jake did:

Week 1: Uploaded his PNOE test to MetaboMaxPro
Week 2-12: Followed the AI-generated training plan

The difference?
❌ Before: Random HIIT workouts, guessing at intensity
✅ After: Precise Zone 2/Zone 4 splits based on HIS lactate threshold

Plus:
- Peptide protocol (BPC-157 + TB-500) dosed for his metabolism
- Supplement timing aligned with his fat oxidation curve
- Quarterly retesting to track adaptation

Result: 7-point VO2 max increase in 3 months.

This is what happens when you train with DATA, not guesswork.

Upload your test: metabomaxpro.com
