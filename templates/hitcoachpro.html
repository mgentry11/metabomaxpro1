                    <h3>Maximum Results, Minimum Time</h3>
                    <p>HIT is a strength training methodology that emphasizes brief, intense workouts focusing on slow, controlled movements to complete muscle fatigue. One set per exercise is all you need.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-card">
                    <div class="icon">🧬</div>
                    <h3>Proven by Science</h3>
                    <p>Decades of research demonstrate that HIT produces equal or superior strength and muscle gains compared to traditional high-volume training, with significantly less time investment and joint stress.</p>

                    <p>The controlled, deliberate nature of HIT makes it ideal for those over 50. Lower injury risk, minimal joint impact, and efficient recovery align perfectly with mature physiology.</p>

                    <h3>Research-Backed Effectiveness</h3>
                    <p class="section-intro">High-Intensity Training has been extensively studied for over four decades, with consistent findings demonstrating its effectiveness for building strength and muscle mass in adults of all ages, with particular benefits for those over 50.</p>

                            <p>Multiple research studies with men and women over 50 have demonstrated that HIT protocols produce significant muscle gains (8-12 lbs of lean mass in 10-12 weeks) while simultaneously reducing body fat, without the excessive time and recovery demands of traditional programs.</p>

                    <h3>The HIT Methodology</h3>
                    <p>High-Intensity Training emphasizes quality over quantity. Each exercise is performed for a single set with slow, controlled movements, maintaining constant tension on the muscle until complete failure is reached. This approach maximizes the growth stimulus while minimizing cumulative fatigue and recovery demands.</p>

                    <div class="principle">
                        <h4>One Set to Failure</h4>
                        <p>Each exercise is performed for a single set taken to complete muscular failure. This maximizes the growth stimulus while minimizing fatigue and recovery demands.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="principle">
                        <h4>Controlled Tempo</h4>
                        <p>30-second eccentric (lowering), 20-second concentric (lifting), 40-second final eccentric. This extended time under tension is the key to HIT's effectiveness.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="principle">
                        <h4>Alternating Routines</h4>
                        <p>Alternate between Workout A and B, 2-3 times per week. This provides complete recovery while hitting all major muscle groups twice weekly.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="principle">
                        <h4>Progressive Resistance</h4>
                        <p>Increase weight by 5-10% when you can complete the full set (90 seconds total time under tension) with good form. Steady, sustainable progress.</p>
